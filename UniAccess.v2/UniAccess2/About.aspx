         UniAccess is an online app created mainly for college students and the entities who target such.
         It serves as a portal of live information and access to analytical decisions which will accomodate the transition from high school, to undergrad and to entrepeneur.
         With an easily navigated map with intutive icons, students and other users may interact and garner much needed information
         such as boarding, medical information and of course entertainment. Most of all, students can find investors, be investors and find other professionals interested in their field.
         With free ads and the ability to add new locations to the map, everyone can change and transform their experience on UniAccess.
